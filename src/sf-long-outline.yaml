  Numeral pennants and the Answering Pennant.

  These pennants have a 3×1 aspect ratio and the fly is ⅓ the height of the
  hoist. All images have outlines so they are suitable for display or printing
  on any background including plain white. Designs and colours have been
  selected to appear similar to real pennants in common use.
