  Numeral pennants and the Answering Pennant.

  These pennants have a 3×1 aspect ratio and the fly is ⅓ the height of the
  hoist. Images do not have outlines so may not work well on a white or light 
  background. Designs and colours have been selected to appear similar to real
  pennants in common use.
