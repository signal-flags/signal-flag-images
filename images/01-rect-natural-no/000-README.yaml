description:
  short: Rectangular (4x3) flags in natural colours without outlines.
  full: |
    These flags and pennants are recommended for use internationally where
    rectangular letter flags are more familiar than square.
    The flags do not have outlines so should not be used on a white background.

    Colours and designs have been selected to be similar to 'real' flags and
    pennants in common use.
