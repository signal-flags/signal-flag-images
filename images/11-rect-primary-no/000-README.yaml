description:
  short: Rectangular (4x3) flags in primary colours without outlines.
  full: |
    These flags and pennants are recommended for use internationally where
    rectangular letter flags are more familiar than square.
    The flags do not have outlines so should not be used on a white background.

    Flags are displayed in primary colours rather than the more natural
    default shades.
