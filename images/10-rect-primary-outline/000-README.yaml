description:
  short: Rectangular (4x3) flags in primary colours with outlines.
  full: |
    These flags and pennants are recommended for use internationally where
    rectangular letter flags are more familiar than square.
    All flags and pennants have outlines so they are suitable for display or
    printing on a white background.

    Flags are displayed in primary colours rather than the more natural
    default shades.
