description:
  short: Square flags in natural colours with outlines.
  full: |
    These flags and pennants are recommended for use in the US and elsewhere
    where square letter flags are used.
    All flags and pennants have outlines so they are suitable for display or
    printing on a white background.

    Colours and designs have been selected to be similar to 'real' flags and
    pennants in common use.
