We have also included images with square alphabet flags in primary colours; this
is the format used on
[WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags)
and (except for the swallowtail flags A and B) in
[Flags Of the World](https://www.fotw.info/flags/xf~ics.html).

## Quick start 2 - use on a website

You can load a single image from the content delivery network (CDN) jsdelivr in
an image tag. You can control the size of the image either by setting properties
on the image itself:

```html
<img
  height="120px"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/signal-flag-images@2/sf-outline/a.svg"
/>
```

... or by wrapping in another element:

```html
<div style="width: 240px;">
  <img
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/signal-flag-images@2/sf-outline/n1.svg"
  />
</div>
```

If you do it this way each image will be loaded separately which will be slow if
you have lots of images. In this case it would be better, and almost as easy,
to use the JavaScript software that generates these images. To see how to do
this visit https://signalflags.org/.

## Documentation

[![Build status](https://github.com/signal-flags/signal-flag-images/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/signal-flags/signal-flag-images/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

These images are free to use: see https://unlicense.org/.

The images are automatically generated by the `signal flags` open source
software for precision and consistency and includes designs for all flags
used internationally:

- Alphabet flags A-Z
- Numeral pennants 0-9
- Answering pennant (AP)
- First, second, third and fourth substitutes.
- All flags used in the Racing Rules of Sailing:
  - orange flag for the start line
  - black flag for starts
  - blue and yellow flags for match racing
  - umpires’ green and white, and red flags, and a black and white flag for team
    racing
  - +/-, red square and green triangle flags for moving marks.

Images are provided in the SVG vector format and five sets of flag images are
included with the following options:

- with or without outlines for ease of use in print or on screen against any
  background
- 4×3 or square shapes for alphabet flags
- 2×1 or 3×1 ('long') shapes for pennants
- square alphabet flags in primary colours for 3rd party compatibility.

## Changes

**v3.0.0** _21 March 2021_
Version 3 introduces a new directory structure which breaks compatibility with
previous versions. Images are now sorted into separate directories described
above (individual flag names have not changed however). In addition, v3 has the
following new features and improvements:

- 11 new flags
- improvements to some designs for greater familiarity with 'real' flags and
  pennants (I, P and S flags and 1 and 2 pennents)
- additional 'long' pennants in 3×1 aspect ratio, again for greater familiarity
  with the prototype (2×1 aspect ratio pennants are still available)
- images are now grouped into directories by 'type' (flag, pennant, triangle),
  avoiding duplication of identical image files in previous versions.

**v2.2.0** _16 March 2021_

- White elements are now 'white smoke' `#f5f5f5` (except for primary colour
  option).

**v2.1.1** _15 March 2021_

- Fixed path of bottom white stripe on 3rd Substitute.

**v2.1.1** _15 March 2021_

- Breaking: new images folder locations.

These images were created on 22 March 2021 using
`signal-flags` version 2.3.0-dev.
