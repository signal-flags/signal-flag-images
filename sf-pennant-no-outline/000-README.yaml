  Numeral pennants and the Answering Pennant.

  These pennants have a 3Ã—1 aspect ratio and the fly is one third the height of
  the hoist. Images do not have outlines so may not work well on a white or
  light background. Designs and colours have been selected to appear similar to
  real pennants in common use.
