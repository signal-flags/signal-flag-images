  Numeral pennants and the Answering Pennant.

  These pennants have a 3Ã—1 aspect ratio and the fly is one third the height of
  the hoist. The images use primary RGB colours and are not therefore
  recommended for use on screen or in print; they are provided for compatibility
  with some 3rd party resources.
